<br><br><br>With the new year already here, I’ve been brainstorming ways to get organized for 2018. And after a quick trip to the craft store, I came up with a wall hooks idea to give my jackets, bags, scarves, etc a much-needed place to hang on the wall.<br><br>

When these DIY wall hooks are not in use, they just look like cool geometric shapes, blending in with any decor as a wall art installation. But when you need ’em, they’re there – functioning as any other wall hook would. And they’re so easy to make with just a few supplies too! Click through for the tutorial.<br><br>


<i>FYI – I originally created this DIY project for <b>Domino</b> and am sharing it here, with permission.</i><br><br><br><br>

What You’ll Need<br>
<ul>
<li>double ended screws<br></li>
<li>wood blocks various sizes and 2 or 3 inch diameter dowel rods<br></li>
<li>pliers<br></li>
<li>drill<br></li>
<li>clamp vise<br></li>
<li>(optional) acrylic paint and paint brush</li><br><br><br><br>
</ul>

<img id="article_2" src="images/article_2.jpg">

How-to <br>
<ul>
<li>If using a large dowel rod for any wall hooks, start by placing rod into clamp vise and cutting 3-5 inch pieces of dowel rod with a saw or jigsaw. Then, sand edges if needed.<br><br></li>

<li>Next, keeping the block in the clamp vise, drill a pilot hole in the center of each block (don’t go all the way through).<br><br></li>

<li>Insert one end of the double ended screw into the hole and use a pair of pliers to screw in and secure. Stop at the halfway point.<br><br></li>

<li>If you want to keep the wood raw they’re ready to hang (screw into the wall), but if you want to add some color, you can paint them with acrylic paint. I went with two-toned painted dowels, at first. But when hanging everything, I decided I liked the raw wood blocks best. So I used mainly the unpainted blocks in the entryway, in the end. Which is why I didn’t show the painting portion of the hooks in the steps. I think the wooden circle hooks are my favorite. They look like little bubbles on the wall.<br><br><br><br></li>

<b>UPDATE:</b> If you’re planning to hang heavy items from these hooks, be sure to first add a wall anchor <i>(like these from Amazon)</i> before screwing the hook into the wall.<br><br>

Are you getting organized in the new year?! Could your entryway use a revamp with these DIY wall hooks?
